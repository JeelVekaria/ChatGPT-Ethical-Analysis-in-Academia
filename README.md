# ChatGPT-Ethical-Analysis-in-Academia
Research project that I and a group of 4 students conducted the use of ChatGPT in Academia, namely universities and colleges. Data was collected through surveys and after a collection of 100 submissions. We fed that data into our Python code which imported Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib, for data visualization. We prepared a presentation and a report conducting our findings in this research.
